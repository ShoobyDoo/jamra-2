# Windows Build Docs

> **Note:** These documents describe the legacy Electron packaging workflow. The app now ships via Tauri; use this folder for historical reference until the new Tauri packaging guide lands.

This folder documents the working, battle‑tested setup for packaging the Electron + Vite + React frontend with an embedded Express backend and better-sqlite3 on Windows. Start with Windows-Electron-Packaging.md, and use Troubleshooting-Windows.md to diagnose issues fast.
